# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app

![Design preview for the Calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In this project I built simple web calculator made with vanilla JS HTML and CSS. With basic functionality of adding or multipling numbers it also have theme changer for someone who want to change design of website! In future I will make small changes in this project, making it responsive(that wasn't my main goal in this project) so I decided to leave it like this for now. Hope you enjoy it!
